Written Assignment # 3: AI Response

Week 3: Climate Misinformation and AI Response and Rubric (10 points)

Introduction:
AI and climate literacy are important skills to build as both AI usage and climate
misinformation are on the rise in the US and beyond. This is due to the rapidly
developing nature of generative AI models like ChatGPT and the increasing polarization
of the topic of climate change. Building off your response to the AI and climate change
article last week, we will be assessing how AI could potentially be a tool for climate
misinformation and explore how we critically evaluate information. Questions we will
explore in this assignment include: why does misinformation seem real, what arguments
are misrepresented, and what might motivate someone to spread misinformation.

Instructions:
1. For this assignment, you will need to login to: https://chat.openai.com/
Everyone should use the free version of ChatGPT (ChatGPT 4, no additional suffixes)
2. Ask ChatGPT 4 to produce realistic misinformation related to climate change.
If you are having trouble coming up with a prompt, feel free to use or refer to this one for
inspiration:

“I am a student in a college level intro to climate change class. I have an
assignment where students will examine a piece of AI generated misinformation
about a climate related process and critique the text generated. Would you be
able to provide a long format example of this form of text that seems realistic and
plausible?”

I find that stating you are in a class and have this assignment generates the type of text
we want to critique rather than a list of common misinformation, but if you feel more
comfortable with critiquing a list that is also acceptable. Please feel free to ask ChatGPT
to generate misinformation about specific climate process (for example: Changing sea
ice extent and sea level rise or carbon dioxide emissions)

If you’d rather not use AI at all, send me an email and I will provide you with an
alternative assignment for this week.

Note on AI Usage:
The usage of AI for the assignment is limited to the generation of the text you will be
critiquing and to any usage that helps your ability to critically examine the text or type
edit your response. For example, you may use AI to help identify the key arguments
made by the fictional author or use it to edit your response for grammatical mistakes or
changes to word usage. You are not allowed to use the AI to generate the main
body of text for your response in part or full.

3. You should then analyze and critique what ChatGPT 4 produced. Your response
should: 
- Include the ChatGPT generated text (0.5 pts)
- Be around 350 words minimum (2.5 pts)
- Include discussion on at least 4 of the below discussions points from any of
the following categories AND reflect on the role of AI in climate science
communication: (7 pts total, breakdown below)

Discussion Points (6 pts)
- What parts of the misinformation make it seem real?  (this mainly applies
to long format texts rather than lists of common misinformation)
  - Does the text claim to include an expert opinion?
  - How does the text support its claims?
  - Who might this misinformation be targeted at? Who do you think is
    meant to believe this information?
  - Why might someone believe the arguments that are being
    presented?

- What arguments are being misrepresented?
  - What does the text claim to be the silver lining or the truth?
  - Why are these claims false or incomplete based on your
    learning so far?

- What is not being considered in the arguments being presented?
  - Do you think that there is only one side of the argument being
    presented?
  - What context or additional information missing from these
    arguments?
  - Is the text sugar coating any aspects of the climate process?
    How so?

      - For example, if they claim higher temperatures
        promote plant life, why is that not enough to offset the
        negatives or what is not being said in addition to that?

- What might motivate someone to spread misinformation?
  - Who might want to create misinformation in general?
  - Why would someone create misinformation on this topic?
  - How might someone benefit from the delay of climate action or
    providing a skewed perspective on climate change?

Reflection (1 pt)
- What is the role of AI in climate science communication? (Use these as
guides for your reflection but feel free to reflect on this assignment
and AI in ways not listed here as well)
  - Is AI capable of making realistic arguments against climate change,
    in your opinion?
  - Do you think that it would be hard to determine if misinformation
    came from AI or a person?
  - How might AI be used to combat misinformation?
  - Is AI literacy an important skill to develop? Why or why not?
  - What might responsible use of AI in climate communication look
    like?
